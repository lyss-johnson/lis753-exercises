      <h1>Friends of the Palo Alto Library<br>Used Book Sale</h1>
    </header>

    <main class="wrapper"> <!Text below is sample text from Friends of the Palo Alto Library book sale flier for class project>
      <p>We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more at our monthly sale. These are mostly from donations from individuals, estates, and companies. We also sell items that the Palo Alto library has removed from their shelves to make room for new purchases. </p>

      <h2><u>General Information</u></h2>
      <ul>
        <li> We hand out a maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room, beginning at 8 am on the Saturday of the sale. If you receive a ticket, the number on it reserves your corresponding place in the line, allowing you to go off and get coffee or to visit the Children's and Bargain Book rooms. Please be sure to return to the Main Room a few minutes before it opens to reclaim your part of the line. Because of our severe space limitations and compelling issues of health and safety, we will only allow 160 customers into the Main Room at a time. On Saturdays, customers will be originally admitted in the order of their numbered tickets that are given out from 8 to 11 am.
        <li> Once inside the main room, customers may take only 12 books off of shelves, after which they should purchase these and exit via the east door. They may then join at the end of any remaining line at the north door and reenter in that order. The limitation of 12 books at a time will continue past noon if a line remains outside.
        <li> Please note that the Children's and Bargain Rooms open one hour earlier than the Main Room on Saturday.
        <li> In the Children's Room during the first hour of the sale on Saturday, please select no more than 12 books at a time, and bring them to the cashiers to hold until you are ready to pay for all your purchases
        <li> Please bring your large book donations to the Main Sale Room.
        <li> You can also purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations.
      </ul>
