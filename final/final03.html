            <dt>Size</dt>
            <dd>- Most foxes are around the same size as medium-sized dogs. They can weigh as little as 1.5 lbs. and as much as 24 lbs. They can also grow to 34 inches from their head to their flanks, tails can add an additional 12 to 22 inches.</dd>
            <dt>Habitat</dt>
            <dd>- Foxes usually live in forested areas, though they are also found in mountains, grasslands and deserts. They make their homes by digging burrows in the ground. These burrows, also called dens, provide a cool area to sleep, a good location to store food and a safe place to have their pups. Burrows have several exits so that they can flee if a predator enters the burrow.</dd>
            <dt>Diet</dt>
            <dd>- A fox's diet can consist of small animals, such as lizards, voles, rats, mice, rabbits and hares. They round out their diet with birds, fruits and bugs.</dd>
            <dt> Living </dt>
            <dd>- Foxes live very short lives in the wild. They often live only around three years. In captivity, they can live much longer. As long as 10 to 12 years.</dd>
